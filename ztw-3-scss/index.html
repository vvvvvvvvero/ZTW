        How WEB Works: A Guide for Beginners in Web Development
      </p>
      <p class="first-section">
        If you're a newbie web developer, you probably already know how the
        world wide web works, at least at a basic level. But when you start
        explaining to someone how a website works, you fail.

      <p class="second-section">
        What is an IP address? How does the client-server model actually work?
        We will cover these topics in the article.
      </p>
      <p class="third-section">
        Let's start where we've all been before: enter "www.github.com" into
        your browser's address bar and watch the page load. At first glance, it
        may seem that some kind of magic is happening here. But let's look
        deeper.
      </p>

    <div class="terms" id="terminology">
      <p class="title">Defining parts of the WEB</p>
      <p class="server">
        <span>Server</span> <br />
        A computer that is connected to the Internet and also has an IP address.
        The server waits for requests from other machines (for example, the
        client) and responds to them. Unlike your computer (i.e. the client),
        which also has an IP address, the server has special server software
        installed and running that tells it how to respond to incoming requests
        from your browser. The main function of a web server is to store,
        process and deliver web pages to clients. There are many types of
        servers, including web servers, database servers, file servers,
        application servers, and more.
      </p>
      <p class="client">
        <span>Client</span> <br />
        An application, such as Chrome or Firefox, that is running on a computer
        and connected to the Internet. Its main role is to take user commands
        and translate them into requests to another computer called a web
        server. Although we typically use a browser to access the Internet, you
        can think of your entire computer as a "client" in the client-server
        model. Each client computer has a unique address, called an IP address,
        which other computers can use to identify themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="ip-address">
        <span>IP Address</span> <br />
        Internet Protocol Address. Numeric identifier of a device (computer,
        server, printer, router, etc.) on a TCP/IP network. Every computer on
        the Internet has an IP address, which it uses to identify and
        communicate with other computers. IP addresses have four sets of numbers
        separated by decimal points (for example, 244.155.65.2). This is called
        a "logical address". To determine the device's location on the network,
        the logical IP address is converted to a physical address by TCP/IP
        protocol software. This physical address (i.e. MAC address) is built
        into the hardware.
      </p>
      <p class="isp">
        <span>ISP</span> <br />
        Internet service provider. The Internet provider is an intermediary
        between the client and servers. To the typical homeowner, the IP is
        usually the “cable company.” When the browser receives a request from
        you to go to www.github.com, it doesn't know where to look for
        www.github.com. It is the ISP's job to do a DNS (Domain Name System)
        lookup to ask what IP address the site you are trying to visit is
        configured to.
      </p>
      <p class="dns">
        <span>DNS</span> <br />
        Domain Name System. A distributed database that stores the
        correspondence between domain names of computers and their IP addresses
        on the Internet. Don't worry about how the "distributed database" works
        now: just know that DNS exists to allow users to enter www.github.com
        instead of an IP address.
      </p>
      <p class="tcp-ip">
        <span>TCP/IP</span> <br />
        The most widely used communication protocol. A "protocol" is simply a
        standard set of rules for something. TCP/IP is used as a standard for
        transmitting data over networks.
      </p>
      <p class="port">
        <span>Port</span> <br />
        A 16-bit integer that identifies a specific port on a server and is
        always associated with an IP address. It serves as a way to identify a
        specific process on a server to which network requests can be forwarded.
      </p>
      <p class="http">
        <span>HTTP</span> <br />
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol. A protocol used by web browsers and web
        servers to communicate with each other over the Internet.
      </p>
      <p class="url">
        <span>URL</span> <br />
        URLs identify a specific web resource. Simple example
        https://github.com/someone. The URL specifies the protocol ("https"),
        the hostname (github.com), and the filename (someone's profile page).
        The user can retrieve the web resource identified by this URL via HTTP
        from a network host whose domain name is github.com.

      <p class="first-section">
        Now we have the necessary foundation to understand what happens behind
        the scenes when we enter a Github address into the search bar:
      </p>

      <div class="step-1">
        <p><span>1.</span> Enter the URL in the browser</p>
        <img src="./img/step-1.png" />
      </div>

      <div class="step-2">
        <p>
          <span>2.</span> The browser parses the information contained in the
          URL. This includes the protocol (“https”), domain name (“github.com”),
          and resource (“/”). In this case, there is nothing after the ".com"
          that points to a specific resource, so the browser only knows how to
          get the main (index) page.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/step-2.png" />
      </div>

      <div class="step-3">
        <p>
          <span>3.</span> The browser contacts the ISP to perform a DNS lookup
          of the IP address for the web server that hosts the www.github.com web
          server. The DNS service will first contact the root name server, which
          looks up https://www.github.com and responds with the name server IP
          address for the .com top-level domain. Having received this address,
          the DNS service makes another request to the name server, which is
          responsible for the .com domain and requests the address
          https://www.github.com.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/step-3.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="step-4">
        <p>
          <span>4.</span> After receiving the IP address of the destination
          server, the ISP sends it to the web browser.
          <img src="./img/step-4.png" />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-5">
        <p>
          <span>5.</span> Your browser takes the IP address and the specified
          port number from the URL (the default HTTP protocol is port 80 and
          HTTPS is port 443) and opens a TCP socket. At this point, the
          connection between the web browser and the web server is finally
          established.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-6">
        <p>
          <span>6.</span> Your web browser sends an HTTP request to the web
          server of the main HTML page www.github.com.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/step-6.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="step-7">
        <p>
          <span>7.</span> The web server receives the request and looks up this
          HTML page. If the page exists, the web server prepares a response and
          sends it back to the browser. If the server cannot find the requested
          page, it sends an HTTP 404 error message (the same Error 404 Not
          Found), which means “Page not found.”
        </p>
        <img src="./img/step-7.png" />

      <div class="step-8-9-10">
        <div class="step-8">
          <p>
            <span>8.</span> Your web browser takes the HTML page it receives and
            then parses it, doing a full crawl to find other resources that are
            listed in it: URLs for images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-9">
          <p>
            <span>9.</span> For each resource listed, the browser repeats the
            entire process above, making additional HTTP requests to the server
            for each resource.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-10">
          <p>
            <span>10.</span> Once the browser has finished downloading all other
            resources listed on the HTML page, the page will be loaded into the
            browser window and the connection will be closed.

        But wait - the work isn't finished yet! Now that your browser has the
        resources that make up a website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.),
        it must go through several steps to present the resources to you in a
        readable web page. The browser has a rendering engine that is
        responsible for displaying content. The rendering engine receives the
        contents of resources in small chunks. Then there is an HTML parsing
        algorithm that tells the browser how to parse the resources.
      </p>
      <div class="dom">
        <p>
          After analysis, a tree structure of DOM elements is created. DOM
          (Document Object Model) stands for Document Object Model and is a
          shorthand for representing objects located in an HTML document. These
          objects - or "nodes" - of each document can be manipulated using
          scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/dom.png" />
      </div>
      <p class="section-2">
        After building the DOM tree, the style sheets are analyzed to understand
        how to determine the style of each node. Using this information, the
        browser traverses down the DOM nodes and calculates the CSS style,
        position, coordinates, etc. for each node. Once the browser has DOM
        nodes and their styles, it is finally ready to draw the page on the
        screen accordingly. The result is everything you have ever viewed on the
        Internet.
